# Table_Editor_E_Tools
This is the first tool, I will create for the E-learning designers to recreate add attributes onto tables.
For this Tool, it will be script that they can run and it be done all on the browser.
This is done for an ease of secure and non privacy breaching action and everything will be open source.
